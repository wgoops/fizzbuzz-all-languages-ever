how the fuck am I gonna write fizzbuzz for a dead computer.

I guess we turn to emulators

AFTER 9 INSTRUCTIONS IT SKIPS TO 17 
AND THEN FROM 17 IT GOES 18 19 27 28 29 37 38 39 
WHAT THE HELL 
oh, uh, I think it's bugged? 
I fixed it by jumping from 9 to 10 

gonna have to restructure my entire fizzbuzz thing again

welp looks like I might have finished this thing without an excel sheet
